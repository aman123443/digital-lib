## üöÄ Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, please follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
* Java JDK 17 or later
* Apache Maven
* Node.js and npm
* A local PostgreSQL instance

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aman123443/digital-lib.git](https://github.com/aman123443/digital-lib.git)
    cd digital-lib/bookstore
    ```
2.  **Configure the database:**
    Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and set up your local PostgreSQL connection:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_local_db_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_postgres_user
    spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```
3.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    You will need to set `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRATION`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` as environment variables in your IDE (IntelliJ) for the backend to run.
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup (React)
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend 
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up the environment file:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory and add the following line:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is busy).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables to be set on the deployment platforms (Render and Vercel).

#### Backend (Render)
* `DB_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL database.
* `DB_PORT`: The port for the database (e.g., `5432`).
* `DB_NAME`: The name of the database.
* `DB_USER`: The username for the database.
* `DB_PASS`: The password for the database.
* `JWT_SECRET`: A long, secure, random string for signing JWTs.
* `JWT_EXPIRATION`: Token expiration time in milliseconds (e.g., `3600000`).
* `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Google Gemini API.

#### Frontend (Vercel)
* `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The full URL of the live deployed backend (e.g., `https://digital-lib-xbze.onrender.com`).
